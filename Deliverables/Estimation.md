# Estimate by product decomposition
### 
|             | Estimate                        |             
| ----------- | ------------------------------- |  
| NC = 150    | Model Classes = 20, View = 100, Controller = 30 |             
| A =  100    |                            | 
| S =  15000  | |
| E = 1500    | Assuming 10 LOC per person hour |
